This folder ([strain_maps](strain_maps/)) contains the ImageJ macros to calculate the strains epsx, epsy, epsxy (=epsyx), eps1, eps2, and theta.

The subfolder [strain_maps_modification](strain_maps_modification/) contains a modification of the macros so that only epsx, epsy, and epsxy are calculated.
